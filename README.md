# Series Tracker

Ever go to a bookstore or library and pick up a random book, one you didn't recognize the name of but the art was cool or the description was super compelling? Then you get home and start reading, get a chapter or two in and realize that that not only was this book part of a series but this book was actually the third in a trilogy?

Series Finder solves this problem! When grabbing a new book simply scan the barcode (or type in the ISBN-13) and Series Finder will list all the books in that series, in order, highlighting your current book. Thus preventing you from accidentally reading a series out of order, or starting at part three of a trilogy!
